## Mandatory Features: 
- There must be an automated process to ingest and store the data.
- Trips with similar origin, destination, and time of day should be grouped together.
- Develop a way to obtain the weekly average number of trips for an area, defined by a
bounding box (given by coordinates) or by a region.
- Develop a way to inform the user about the status of the data ingestion without using a
polling solution.
- The solution should be scalable to 100 million entries. It is encouraged to simplify the
data by a data model. Please add proof that the solution is scalable.
- Use a SQL database.
